							Sleepless nights. Skipped meals. Unwatched K-Drama series. <br> 
							After experiencing these for almost two weeks, I can say that <br>
							I'm finally done with these. Although, I'm sure, it will <br>
							happen again. But for now, I want to enjoy my days without stress. <br>
							Before I forgot, I would like to thank, first and foremost, our Almighty <br>
							God, for giving me strength and wisdom to finish this task. <br>
							I would like to thank my parents also, for their non-stop support <br>
							in everything I do. I would like to thank Jobecar Federe as well for <br>
							lending me her laptop. I want to thank my friends also, for their support <br>
							and for helping me when I'm with confusion. I also want to give thanks  <br>
							to my instructor, Mr. Glevinzon Dapal, for giving me this opportunity <br>
							to create a website so I can showcase my knowledge and skills. <br>
							And of course, I want to give my wholeheartedly gratitute to myself. <br>
							It is for not giving up, and for doing best in work. <br> <br>
							
							Without them, this task would never be possible to accomplish and to be done.
